# hal-kinematics
The kdl kinematics "c++" library used by a "c" hal component

You have to install the kdl kineatics c++ library on your system first.
https://github.com/grotius-cnc/orocos_kinematics_dynamics

I preferr you have a qt install. The source code of this repository contains 2 qt projects that are opened together during coding. 
Parallel coding makes it eayser.

This source code is a basic example how to use the kdl kinematic library.
+1 You could make any type of kinematic chain with linuxcnc now.
